On Windows powershell inside my VS code terminal
to change directory, [cd ~/'location'] so in these case, if i want to change directory to my desktop
# it will be cd ~/Desktop

Now i can make a directory inside my current location and the command is [mkdir 'name of the folder']
so assuming i want to create a folder called personalweb
# it will be mkdir personalweb

I can create files inside the directory/folder. eg i want to create a python file where i can code my snake game
so the command is [code 'name of file']
# it will be code snake.py

now i will like to now use git to control this folder; so I will have to initialize a git local repository
inside this directory  [git init]
# it will be git init

to see the files and folders inside our working directory i can use the command
#[Get-ChildItem] or [ls]

now initializing the working directory to become a git local repository is just an addition of a '.git' 
file inside the working directory but when we use the ls or Get-ChildItem it doesn't show the .git file
this is because the .git file is a hidden file and then command above can't show it

so we will learn a new command to show hidden files
# to see all files including hidden ones we use [Get-ChildItem -Force]
# to see only the hidden files, we use [Get-ChildItem -Attrubutes Hidden]

Now for me to actually start tracking the changes that happen to my file, I have to move it from the 
working directory to the staging area. but then I can check wherether my files have been staged on not
by using the command
# git status 

now you can add the file to the staging area to tract changes by using 
# git add 'file name'  but if you will stage all files, the use 
# git add .

after doing all the stuff you wanna do, you can commit the files 
# git commit 
but professionally you have to add a commit message: usually the difference between the file from
the last save point and the current version
so we use the command
# git commit -m "complete version 1"
NB the commit message conventionally should be in present tense; and i used complete version 1 because
there was no previous version of this my document. this is actually the first one.

I can check the commits i have made using the command
# git log
